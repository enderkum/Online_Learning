# Online_Learning
We can use partial_fit() method in sklearn to utilize incremental or online learning. Here is an example showing how to implement it to increase 
accuracy of a machine learning model to perform well on misclassified classes. We achive highner accuracy on a pre-trained model by adding more 
data for a class that the model has low confidence on.
